# Minimum Operations

For this project, you will need to understand several key algorithmic and mathematical concepts to devise a solution that efficiently calculates the minimum number of operations to achieve a given number of characters using only “Copy All” and “Paste” operations. Here is a list of concepts and resources that will be helpful:

# Concepts Needed:

**Dynamic Programming:**

Familiarity with dynamic programming can help in breaking down the problem into simpler subproblems and building up the solution.

**Prime Factorization:**

Understanding how to perform prime factorization is crucial since the problem can be reduced to finding the sum of the prime factors of the target number n.

## Tasks To Complete

+ [x] 0. **Minimum Operations**<br/>[0-minoperations.py](0-minoperations.py) contains a script that meets the following requirements:
  + In a text file, there is a single character `H`. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: `Copy All` and `Paste`. Given a number `n`, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` `H` characters in the file.
    + Prototype: `def minOperations(n)`.
    + `boxes` is a list of lists.
    + Returns an integer.
    + If `n` is impossible to achieve, return `0`.
