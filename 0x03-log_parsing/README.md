# Log Parsing

For the “0x03. Log Parsing” project, you will need to apply your knowledge of Python programming, focusing on parsing and processing data streams in real-time. This project involves reading from standard input (stdin), handling data in a specific format, and performing calculations based on the input data. Here’s a list of concepts and resources that you might find useful:

# Concepts Needed:

1.**File I/O in Python:**

- Understand how to read from sys.stdin line by line.

 [Python Input and Output](# "https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html")

2.**Signal Handling in Python:**

- Handling keyboard interruption (CTRL + C) using signal handling in Python.

[Python Signal Handling](# "https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html")

3.**Data Processing:**

- Parsing strings to extract specific data points.

-Aggregating data to compute summaries.

4.**Regular Expressions:**

- Using regular expressions to validate the format of each line.

[Python Regular Expressions](# "https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html")

5.**Dictionaries in Python:**

- Using dictionaries to count occurrences of status codes and accumulate file sizes.

[Python Dictionaries](#"https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries")

6.**Exception Handling:**

- Handling possible exceptions that may arise during file reading and data processing.

[Python Exceptions](#"https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html")

By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you will be well-prepared to tackle the log parsing project, effectively handling data streams, parsing log entries, and computing metrics based on the processed data.

## Tasks To Complete

+ [x] 0. **Log parsing**<br/>[0-stats.py](0-stats.py) contains a script that reads `stdin` line by line and computes metrics:
  + Input format: `<IP Address> - [<date>] "GET /projects/260 HTTP/1.1" <status code> <file size>` (if the format is not this one, the line must be skipped).
  + After every 10 lines and/or a keyboard interruption (`CTRL + C`), print these statistics from the beginning:
    + Total file size: `File size: <total size>`.
    + Where `<total size>` is the sum of all previous `<file size>` (see input format above)
    + Number of lines by status code:
      + Possible status code: `200`, `301`, `400`, `401`, `403`, `404`, `405` and `500`.
      + If a status code doesn’t appear or is not an integer, don’t print anything for this status code.
      + Format: `<status code>: <number>`.
      + Status codes should be printed in ascending order.
